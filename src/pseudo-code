What's on the menu? Random recipe generator

App in which user can generate a number of random recipes to browse - an app for those who have a hard time making decisions of what to eat and need a structured number of options to choose between.

MVP goals:
1. Form with drop down for user to select how many random recipes they would like returned
2. Upon form submission, a gallery of selected number of random recipes appears with links to each recipe

**APP COMPONENT**
1. Header
3. Recipe Call component (incl form component & recipe gallery component)
4. Footer

**RECIPE CALL COMPONENT**
1. Initialize state to represent the array of recipe objects coming from the API
2. useEffect to make a call to the spoonacular API using number from form as number param & update state using array returned to us from the API
3. return:
    - form component
    - ul wherein we map through state array and for each object in the array, return a recipe component (data passed in as props)
    

**FORM COMPONENT**
1. form that allows user to select (via a drop down) number of random recipes that they would like generator to produce

**RECIPE COMPONENT**
1. component to display data from API
2. use destructuring to extract properties with values we wish to render on the page
    - the name of the recipe
    - an image (& alt text) 
    - ingredients 
    - whether it is appropriate for certain dietary needs 
    - link to recipe

Stretch Goals:
- Advanced filtering (recipes incl. specific ingredients, only recipes that are suitable for certain diets, etc)
- Allow users to save certain recipes for later in a "recipe box" using firebase
